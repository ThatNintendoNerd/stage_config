- New dynamic ground collisions
- Flatten or unflatten battle objects
- Custom center of gravity or the removal thereof
- Use of `stage_additional_setting` values from spirit battles outside of Spirits
- Discard specialized stage programming
- Guarantee behavior resulting from a particular stage hazards setting
